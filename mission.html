                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2025, PowerOnMe LLC is developing next-generation fuel cell systems that convert organic green fuels, ranging from human metabolites to agricultural byproducts, into electricity for autonomous sensing, health regulation, and off-grid power applications. At the core of our innovation is a new class of mixed-reactant fuel cells (MRFCs), engineered through the integration of AI-driven catalyst design and microfluidic control, aiming for compact, low-cost, and high-energy-density power sources that outperform lithium batteries and overcome the limitations of traditional fuel cells.</p>
					<p>In the agricultural and environmental space, PowerOnMe‚Äôs fuel cell technology offers a breakthrough solution for powering remote sensors in off-grid or hard-to-maintain locations. By extracting energy directly from plant sap, soil fluids, or other organic materials readily available in the environment, our systems eliminate the need for battery replacements or wired infrastructure. This enables a new generation of self-powered, low-maintenance environmental sensors‚Äîempowering smarter, more scalable, and more cost-effective precision agriculture and ecological monitoring.</p>
					<p>In the healthcare space, PowerOnMe‚Äôs technology enables truly self-powered bioelectronic systems. By harvesting energy directly from human metabolites such as glucose or uric acid, our devices can not only monitor key health markers in real time, but actively regulate them through closed-loop control‚Äîlaying the foundation for next-generation treatments for chronic conditions like diabetes and gout. In parallel, our high-energy-density miniature fuel cells offer a long-awaited alternative to batteries in implantable devices, reducing the need for risky battery-replacement surgeries in applications such as pacemakers and neurostimulators.</p>
